# Lesson Plan for "HTML!"

## Audience

12-16 year olds

## Time

1.5 hours

## Rationale and Learning Objectives

Students experiment with basic HTML in the code playground environment, and are exposed to the concepts of **tags** and **elements**. They fill in text in `<p>` tags, and create lists with `<ul>` and `<li>`. Lter, they are exposed to `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<nav>` tags as well.

## Preparation

### Materials Required

- [ ] Configured Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Configured Code Playground
- [ ] Printouts for offline activities
- [ ] Glue sticks
- [ ] Scissors
- [ ] Rope/string
- [ ] Post its
- [ ] Markers

### Room Setup

- Computer Lab, with 2-4 chairs at space near each computer
- Room to stand (could move outside for activity)

## Outline

1. **Introduction** (10 minutes)
1. **Let's learn about computers** (30 minutes)
  - Activity: Giving a Computer Instructions
  
1. **Introduction to HTML** (70 minutes)
  - Activity: Creating your first site

  - Activity: Classroom Tags
1. **Conclusion** (10 minutes)

## Facilitation



### Building Blocks of HTML

The point where students begin to take the matter into their hand and actually write html code that they can see the result.

#### Activity: Creating your first site

Designed to show the students the workings of an HTML page prior to introducing the key concepts of **tags** and **elements**. Make sure everyone is comfortable with the code playground and that every group is working in the code playground

- An html cheat sheet is posted with the material
- Suggested time: 10 minutes

#### Activity: Locating Tags and Elements

**Tags** is a small section with paired activity to promote the group work in the classroom. Help the students to find all the tags in the example code and identify them.

- Suggested time: 10 minutes.

**Elements** is  small ection. Follow as before. Make sure the students understand what elements are. Help them identify them.
  - **Activity 1-3** should be a fairly straight up exercise after the last section. Help the students find all the elements in the starter code.

#### Activity: Changing the look of text

Brief intro to changing the appearance of text using **<strong>**, _<em>_ and <mark><mark></mark>. These tags are in an activity at the beginning of the second session.

#### Activity: Making a list of holiday foods

This short activity introduces the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags, and asks the students to add a list of favourite foods to their short web pag page. 

#### Activity: Classroom Tags

Offline activity: tag "elements" in the classroom using sticky notes. This offline activity, modelled on Mozilla's "HTML Thimble Tag" (see below), is intended to reinforce the tag/element concepts and to help students think about a web page as an object that they "build" from component elements.
