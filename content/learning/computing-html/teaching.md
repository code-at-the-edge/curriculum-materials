## Facilitation


### Let's learn about computers

Provides a short introduction to computational thinking, the World Wide Web and Internet and how we "talk" to Computers

#### Activity: Giving a Computer Instructions

As an instructor have students give you instructions to open the door to the room.

### Building Blocks of HTML

The point where students begin to take the matter into their hand and actually write html code that they can see the result.

#### Activity: Creating your first site

Designed to show the students the workings of an HTML page prior to introducing the key concepts of **tags** and **elements**. Make sure everyone is comfortable with the code playground and that every group is working in the code playground

- An html cheat sheet is posted with the material
- Suggested time: 10 minutes

#### Activity: Locating Tags and Elements

**Tags** is a small section with paired activity to promote the group work in the classroom. Help the students to find all the tags in the example code and identify them.

- Suggested time: 10 minutes.

**Elements** is  small ection. Follow as before. Make sure the students understand what elements are. Help them identify them.
  - **Activity 1-3** should be a fairly straight up exercise after the last section. Help the students find all the elements in the starter code.

#### Activity: Changing the look of text

Brief intro to changing the appearance of text using **strong** and _emphasis_. These tags are in an activity at the beginning of the second session.

#### Activity: Changing the look of text

#### Activity: Making a list of holiday foods

#### Activity: Classroom Tags
