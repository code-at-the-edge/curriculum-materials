# Adding Style with CSS

Today we will talk about how to add âœ¨ style âœ¨ to your web sites. By the end of the class you will know how to:

- change the colour and font of text
- change the background colour
- recognize the different sections of your web site

Before that let's review what we did yesterday!

## Review: Parts of a web page and styling text

1. Open your code playground. You should be able to see your code from last session, if not, you can use this:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>Favourite foods</title>
    </head>
    <body>

      <h1>My favourite foods</h1>
      <p>I like to eat...</p>

      <p>During the holidays these are my favourite dishes:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>First Holiday
        <ul>
          <li>Dish 1</li>
          <li>Dish 2</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Second Holiday
        <ul>
          <li>Dish 1</li>
          <li>Dish 2</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Third Holiday</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Ranked list of my favourite foods</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Dish name</li>
        <li>Dish name</li>
        <li>Dish name</li>
        <li>Dish name</li>
      </ol>

    </body>
    </html>
    ```
  **Your turn**:
    - Can you <mark>highlight</mark> your **least** favourite dish on the list?
    - Can you make all the Holiday names *italic*?

1. We also saw that web pages have different **sections** that create a broad outline, kind of like how you would a document on paper. These include `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>` and `<section>`, can you guess what they do?

1. Take a look at the code here, and add it to your `<article>` element


### Activity 1 ðŸ’»

1. Open [style file](style.css) and copy its content into the CSS section of your code playground.

  CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets** and is a way to change the colour and fonts on your web pages as well as everything else about how they look, we'll learn more about this in a little bit!

2. For now, copy the code below in the HTML section of your code playground

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
      <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <main>
        <header>

        </header>

        <nav>
        </nav>

        <section class="sidebar">
        </section>

        <article>
          <p>
          </p>
        </article>

        <aside>

        </aside>
      </main>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

3. Write a short paragraph with a headline about your favourite foods and your school in `<article>`. Make sure to use the `<p>` and `<h2>` tags.

4. Use `<h1>` and write a title for your document in `<header>` element.

5. You can draw attention to text in a couple ways:
  `<strong>important</strong>` to show text is **important**
  `<em>emphasize</em>` to *emphasize* text similar to how you speak

6. Keep playing with this template. You should be able to understand what purpose each of the tags play in the presentation of the document.

7. Your instructor should provide you with links to some images. Use the snippet code below to add pictures to your `<section>` element.

```html
<img alt="a description of the image here" src="[the link goes here]" />
```


## Style and HTML

You can change a lot in terms of the style in a html document. You can already see what lays in the possibilities.

However, the way we have been doing these modifications seems to be highly inefficient. Imagine if you have lots of Heading 2s and you want to change their color all to `red`. Certainly it does not seem convenient to go around and add lots and lots of tags to change the color of each Heading to red.

There must be a way to control the stylistic organization of web page.

Happily there are ways. With an external **stylesheet** we can give instructions to a computer on how to display the contents of a html document.

One of the solutions is to use **CSS** (**Cascading Style Sheets**).

You have already been using CSS. Let's now learn about it with an activity.

### Activity 2 ðŸ’»

1. Open your code from the last session. You had written a title for your page under the `<header>` tag with use of `<h1>` tag.

2. Now add the starter code here to the CSS section of your code playground. Remember not to change the rest of the CSS code.

```css
h1 {
  font-weight:normal;
  color: white;
  font-size: 40px;
  font-family: Courier;
  background-color: Green;
  text-align: center;
}
```

3. Do you see the result? Take a moment and try some variations to better understand how the CSS is changing the way the content of the HTML is represented.

4. Now try to make some difference on the appearance of your `<p>` elements. Try changing the color, the background and the alignment.

# Introduction to CSS

In the last activity you made your first CSS modifications. CSS is a programming language which is used to change the way a HTML document is represented in a web browser.

A good way to think about this is to imagine the HTML document as the skeleton of a web page, and the CSS document as the appearance of the body. HTML is the *structural layer* and CSS is the *presentation layer*.

As it is illustrated above, CSS can turn your HTML into a wonderful web page.

In the last activity you used `h1{}` to change some stuff with the way the `<h1>` is presented in the HTML documented.

To understand CSS you need to understand what are `selectors` and `properties`

![alt text](./images/css-syntax.jpg)

As you can see, we can generalize and say we can change properties of HTML tags through defining `selectors` in the CSS code and modifying some of the properties of the tag in that selector.
Take notice of the way we use `{`,`}`, and `;`. These are mandatory.

We introduce you to 4 ways you can take advantage of CSS powers:

1. You have already used the simple case use through the last activity. You can define a selector for a certain tag and change some of the properties.

1. You can instruct your machine to change some of the properties of a tag, only when the tag is used within a certain tag. Use this code below in your CSS:
  ```css
  section > h2 {
    font-weight:bold;
    color: white;
    font-size: 30px;
    font-family: Courier;
    background-color: Red;
    text-align: center;
  }
  ```
  Now add a `<h2>` element to your `<section>` element. See the difference? `<h2>` does not behave the same in `<section>` and `<article>`.

1. You can define a new `id` and use it in your HTML code. Add this snippet to your CSS.
  ```css
  #box1 {
    grid-area: f;
    background-color: Green;
    text-align: center;
  }
  ```
  Remember we put our nested list from the last activity into a `<div>` element?

1. Now change this line:
  ```html
  <div>
  ```
  To this:
  ```html
  <div id="box1"><section>Box1</section>
  ```

Did you see what happened?
You told the computer to interpret this `<div>` element as a `box1` and it did so for you! Now try to make some more variations.

1. You can also define classes of things. Use this code below in your CSS:
  ```css
  p.extrabig {
      font-weight:bold;
      font-size: 25px;
  }
  ```
  Now add a `<p class="extrabig>` element to your `<article>` element and write something. As you can see, you have changed some properties of the `<p>` element by defining a new `class` and redefining some the properties in there.

### Activity 3 ðŸ’»

1. By now you know a lot about CSS! Try to read the CSS code we have given you. Discuss the code with your partners and fill free to ask about different parts of it from your instructor.

2. Your instructor should have some images ready for you. Get the links from your instructor and add the images to your `<section>` element. Take notice of how this element is of class `sidebar`.

3. We have created a number of boxes for you. Start add stuff to this boxes in your `<article>` element. Try to change some of the properties in different boxes. Maybe change the background in some of them, or change the color.
