We will be exploring how computing and the world wide web work in [What is a Computer](computing-html).

In [HTML!](html), we'll learn one of the main languagges of the web. 

Then we'll learn how to change how web pages look with another language, [CSS](css).

CSS is a big topic, so in [the next lesson](links-layout) we'll focus on two things:
- making links, which is one thing that makes the web so great
- how to put things in different placds in your web page (like you would with a report or a poster)
