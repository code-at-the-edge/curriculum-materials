## Facilitation

### Introduction

### Let's learn about computers

Aims to give a short abstract introduction to computational thinking. This part is fairly short, but important for students who are going to embark for the first time to the world of computational machinery.

### Introduction to html

The point where students begin to take the matter into their hand and actually write html code that they can see the result.

- `HTML` and a first webpage.
  - **Activity 1-1** is designed to show the students the workings of a html document prior to comprehensive knowledge of the mechanism. Allow the students to digest the workings. Make sure everyone is comfortable with the code playground. Make sure to leave no one behind in this activity. Everyone should be comfortable with what going on.
  - An html cheat sheet is posted with the material.
  - Suggested time: 10 minutes.

- `Tags` is another small lecture section. Make sure everyone understand how tags work.
  - You can start discussing how to change the appearance of text using **strong** and _emphasis_. These tags are in an activity at the beginning of the second session.
  - **Activity 1-2** could be use to promote the group work in the classroom. Help the students to find all the tags in the example code and identify them.
  - Suggested time: 10 minutes.

- `Elements` is another small lecture section. Follow as before. Make sure the students understand what elements are. Help them identify them.
  - **Activity 1-3** should be a fairly straight up exercise after the last section. Help the students find all the elements in the starter code.
  - **Activity 1-4** is an extensive activity on making a complete web page with `semantic elements`. Much of the code is already provided as starter code. Make sure they understand how to take advantage of the cheat sheet.
    - CSS is featured as part of the template, however it will not be introduced until the next session.
    - Make sure students do use `<p>`, `<h1>-<h6>`, `<strong>`, `<em>` tags.
    - A shared debrief or show and tell could allow the students to take the time to go through what they have learned today.
    - Encourage the students to personalize their page by using the tags in the cheat sheet.
  - Suggested time: 40 minutes
