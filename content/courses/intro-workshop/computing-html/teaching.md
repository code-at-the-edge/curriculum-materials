## Outline of sections

This session consists of a number of short lectures and some activities. Here you can find a break down of the time dedicated to each, and some tips on how to present the parts to the students.

The session is divided into two separate parts:

1. `Let's learn about computers` aims to give a short abstract introduction to computational thinking. This part is fairly short, but important for students who are going to embark for the first time to the world of computational machinery.

It is good practice to allow students to properly digest the material, and get comfortable in asking their questions within the class environment.

    * Suggested time: `30-40 minutes`.

2. `Intorduction to html` is the point where students begin to take the matter into their hand and actually write html code that they can see the result.

* `Activity 1-1` is designed to show the students the workings of a html document prior to comprehensive knowledge of the mechanism. Allow the students to digest the workings. Make sure everyone is comfortable with the code playground. Make sure to leave no one behind in this activity. Everyone should be comfortable with what going on.

    * A html cheat sheet is posted with the material. Feel comfortable to use that to help the students.
    * Suggested time: `15 minutes`.

* `Tags` is another small lecture section. Make sure everyone understand how tags work. Give them some examples until they are comfortable with the workings of them
    * You can start discussing how to make the text bold, italic, etc. We will include the stylistic tags in an activity in the beginning of the second session.
    * Make sure students understand what is going on. It will be difficult for them to catch on once they lag behind in these topics.
    * Suggested time: `15 minutes`.

* `Activity 1-2` could be use to promote the group work in the classroom. Help the students to find all the tags in the example code and identify them.
    * Suggested time: `15 minutes`.
* `Elements` is another small lecture section. Follow as before. Make sure the students understand what elements are. Help them identify them. You can use this code to give them different examples of elements in html

```
<ul>
  <li>first element</li>
  <li>second element</li>
    <ul>
      <li>second, first element</li>
      <li>second, second element</li>
    </ul>
  <li>third element</li>
</ul>
```

Students yet need not know about how `list` is made. Just help them identify the elements.

    * Suggested time: 20 minutes.
* `Activity 1-3` should be a fairly straight up exercise after the last section. Help the students find all the elements in the starter code.
    * Suggested time: `15 minutes`

* `Activity 1-4` is an extensive activity in which students are supposed to make their very first own web page with `semantic elements`. Much of the code is already provided to the students as starter codes. Make sure the students understand the rational behind their decisions. Make sure they understand how to take advantage of the cheat sheet. Using the manual pages is an important skill any developer should flourish.
    * Students will probably ask you about the CSS. Tell them they will learn about it during the next session.
    * Make sure students do use `<p>`, `<h?>`, `<b>`, `<i>` tags. They should be able to use the proper tags.
    * Allow the students to take the time to go through what they have learned today. It is not easy to take all this information at once.
    * Some student may be lost and reluctant to work on the activities due to intimidation. Reassure them and push them to do the activity.
    * Encourage the students to personalize their page by using the tags in the cheat sheet.
    * Suggested time: `30 minutes`
