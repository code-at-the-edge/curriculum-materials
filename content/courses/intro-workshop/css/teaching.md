# Lesson Plan for Adding Style with CSS

## Audience

12-16 year olds

## Time

2.0 hours

## Rationale and Learning Objectives

- Understanding the basics of nested lists
- Understanding what CSS essentially is (as a stylesheet)
- Recognize the syntax of a CSS document. Students should be able to identify `selectors`, `properties`, and `values`
- Understanding four different ways we could instruct the CSS to stylistically modify the presentation of the HTML document
- Moving toward a web-page as a final project

## Preparation

### Materials Required

- [ ] Configured Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Configured Code Playground

### Room Setup

- Computer Lab, with 2-4 chairs at space near each computer

## Outline

1. **Review: Parts of a web page and styling text** (30 minutes)
    - Activity 1 (15 minutes)
2. **Style and HTML** (35 minutes)
    - Presentation (15 minutes)
    - Activity 2 (20 minutes)
3. **Introduction to CSS** (50 minutes)
   - Presentation (25 minutes)
        - Take notice this presentation requires you to show case 4 different ways of using CSS to change the appearance of HTML. Show case them with student engagement (Maybe 4 micro-activities?)
    - Activity 3 (25 minutes)
        - This should be in accordance to the final project's content
1. **Conclusion** (5 minutes)

## Facilitation

### Activity 1

An extensive activity on making a complete web page with `semantic elements`. Much of the code is already provided as starter code. Make sure they understand how to take advantage of the cheat sheet.
    - CSS is featured as part of the template, however it will not be introduced until the next session.
    - Make sure students do use `<p>`, `<h1>-<h6>`, `<strong>`, `<em>` tags.
    - A shared debrief or show and tell could allow the students to take the time to go through what they have learned today.
    - Encourage the students to personalize their page by using the tags in the cheat sheet.
  - Suggested time: 40 minutes
