We will be exploring how computing and the world wide web work in [What is a Computer](computing).

In [HTML!](html), we'll learn one of the main languagges of the web.

Then we'll learn how to change how web pages look with another language, [CSS](css).

In [the next lesson](links-layout) we'll focus on [making links](links), which is one thing that makes the web so great.

Finally, we'll cover [how to put things in different places](layouts) on your web page (like you would with a report or a poster)
