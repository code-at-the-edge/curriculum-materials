# Curriculum Materials for Code At the Edge

This repo generates a Hugo web site that hosts curriculum materials built for [Code At the Edge](https://github.com/code-at-the-edge) as well as provides install and configuration scripts to host it on a RaspberryPi.


## Web Site Development

First, [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) (you will require v0.48+). Then get the repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:code-at-the-edge/curriculum-materials.git --recursive
```

If you need to update the submodule you can type  `git submodule update --init --recursive`

:rocket:

### Usage

First, start the hugo server from the root directory of your repo:

```shell
cd curriculum-materials
hugo server --navigateToChanged
xdg-open http://localhost:1313/curriculum-materials
```

Hugo will update as you work, though be warned that Firefox is not 100% reliable when it comes to reloading iframes, so you want to use Chrome.

### Adding Materials

For now we have one course, which is found in `content/courses/intro-workshop/`. Each lesson plan gets its own subdirectory which contains several files. Since it's a bit finicky, you may want to use the hugo [archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/) system to generate the new curriculum:

```shell
hugo new --kind lesson courses/intro-workshop/LESSON-TITLE
```
a new directory with the relevant content will be created as `courses/intro-workshop/LESSON-TITLE` and you can work there directly

### Viewing Your Work

Hugo should update automagically in your browser!

## Raspberry Pi Configuration

The following instructions will help you set up and configure a Raspberry Pi that will serve the curricular materials along with a code playground over a local network.

### Set Up

1. Make sure you have the following items:

    - Raspberry Pi 3
    - A microSD card

1. Flash the SD card with [Raspbian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). For detailed instructions, see Raspberry Pi documentation on [Installing operating system images](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)

1. Create an empty file named **ssh** to enable SSH when the Raspberry Pi boots. This can be done can be done from a terminal or shell using the following command:

    ```
    $ touch /path/to/sd/boot/ssh
    ```

1. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi.

1. Plug the Raspberry Pi  into your router so it has connectivity to the Internet. SSH into the Raspberry Pi with `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local` and password **raspberry**.

1. In your SSH session, run `passwd` and change your login password. It is very important to choose a strong password so others cannot remotely access your Raspberry Pi.

1. Make sure you enable the camera and expand the filesystem using the Raspberry Pi configuration: `sudo raspi-config`.

1. Run the **Code at the Edge** install script, then let the installation complete:

    ```
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-at-the-edge/curriculum-materials/master/scripts/install && chmod +x install && ./install
    ```
### What this script does

- [x] download curriculum materials
- [x] download code playground
- [-] install and configure database for code playground
- [ ] install and configure router info
- [ ]
